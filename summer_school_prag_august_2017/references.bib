abstract="This paper proposes a new method of signal extraction from dirty signals with noise. The method is constructed by modeling some constraints of Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA) proposed by Bregman computationally. It segregates the signal from noise by using the amplitude envelope and the phase deviation of the noise-added signal passed through a wavelet filterbank. To evaluate the method, segregation examination of a pure-tone from amplitude modulated narrow-band noise whose center frequency is the same as the pure-tone frequency, is performed. The result indicates that the model can extract the pure-tone, whose SN ratio in creases about 20 dB."}

abstract="This paper proposes a method of extracting the desired signal from a noisy signal, addressing the problem of segregating two acoustic sources as a model of acoustic source segregation base on Auditory Scene Analysis. Since the problem of segregating two acoustic sources is an ill-inverse problem, constraints are needed to determine an unique solution. The proposed method uses the four heuristic regularities proposed by Bregman as constraints and uses the instantaneous amplitude and phase of noisy signal components that have passed through a wavelet filterbank as features of acoustic sources. Then the model can extracts the instantaneous amplitude and phase of the desired signal. Simulations were performed to segregate the harmonic complex tone from a noise-added harmonic complex tone and to compare the results of using all or only some constraints. The results show that the method can segregate the harmonic complex tone precisely using all the constraints related to the four regularities and that 
the absence some constraints reduces the accuracy.",

Challenges for an audio-only system are small-room reverberation, noise, the unknown number of speakers, and gaps occurring in natural speech. Combining models from neurobiology and cognitive psychology with many-channel signal processing and pattern recognition techniques, a hybrid method was developed. By employing online CASA processing to signals from a microphone array, the real-time capable method is able to track an arbitrary number of concurrent moving speakers in highly reverberant environments.},

Acoustic tracking using microphone arrays is a challenging task due to two major reasons: On the one hand, multiple persons may speak simultaneously and thus the number of speakers varies over time; on the other hand, due to the nature of reverberated speech, the provided position hypotheses contain many gaps and clutter. In the pro- posed approach, the �glimpsing model� is realized by neurobiologically inspired calculation of robust but sparse position hypotheses in combination with a Gaussian mixture cardinalized probability hypothesis density filter. By iteratively applying the filter to the position hypotheses from the multiple frequency bands, good results are achieved. Using a statistical speech model derived from recordings, a real-time capable implementation is used to track multiple speakers in a conference room with significant reverberation.},

This blind estimation of the RT is based on a simple statistical model for the sound decay such that the RT can be estimated by means of a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator. The proposed algorithm has a significantly lower computational complexity than previous ML-based algorithms for RT estimation. This is achieved by a downsampling operation and a simple pre-selection of possible sound decays. The new algorithm is more suitable to track time-varying RTs than related approaches. In addition, it can also estimate the RT in the presence of (moderate) background noise. The proposed algorithm can be employed to measure the RT of rooms from sound recordings without using a dedicated measurement setup. Another possible application is its use within speech dereverberation systems for hands-free devices or digital hearing aids.},

abstract = {Is perception of the whole based on perception of its parts? There is psychological and physiological evidence for parts-based representations in the brain, and certain computational theories of object recognition rely on such representations. But little is known about how brains or computers might learn the parts of objects. Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing 
rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},
